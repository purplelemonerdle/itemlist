There’s a lot to the mod that may seem complicated to even more experiencedusers, but this short guide will help you get the hang of things.What is Twitch Toolkit?Twitch Toolkit is a mod by hodlhodl that allows viewers to affect the game in a number of ways. Themost prominent is its store, which allows you to purchase a number ofthings the streamer curated. Depending on the purchase, these things appear in-game or affect thegame in some way. Another way viewers can interact with the game is through the mod’s polls. Thechoices in these polls depend heavily on what’s enabled in the mod.What Are Coins?Coins are the mod’s currency. You can view your balance by using the !bal command.You’ll notice the balance command may have some new emojis. If that’s the case, here is an overviewof the emojis as follows: 💰 represents the amount of coins you current have. ⚖ represents your current karma. 📈 represents the amount of coins you gain everytime the mod awards coins. 📉 represents the amount of coins you lose everytime to mod awards coins.What is Karma?Karma is a system in the mod that tries to limit the amount of negative events a viewer can purchase atone time. This system works by directly modifying that amount of coins viewers get everytime the modawards coins. This means that the lower you karma is, the lower your coin gain is. The hope is thatnegative events get spread out more so the colony can recover.How Do I Use Twitch Toolkit?You can use Twitch Toolkit in a number of ways – the most prominent way is through itscommands. The more important command is the !buycommand, which is the mods entry point into purchasing things from the store. Other notable commandsare the !mypawn commands, which allow you see various information about your pawn. We won’t coverevery command here, but most commands should generally be self-descriptive or have a description ofwhat they do on the commands page." }, { "title" : "Mod List", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/itemlist/modlist", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Harmony Andreas Pardeike2.3.1.0 Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme Oskar Potocki...", "content" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Harmony Andreas Pardeike2.3.1.0 Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Anima Theme Oskar Potocki, Taranchuk and xrushha [1.5] Lovely Hair Style BJInternetSupervision (Updated by Gunseeker) Vanilla Expanded Framework Oskar Potocki, XeoNovaDan, Orion, Kikohi, Taranchuk, Sarg Bjornson and Erdelf1.0.0.0 Erin&#39;s Cat Overhaul Erin1.0.8865.29426 [ATW] Ridiculous Cat Variety MG_Atwood Vanilla Achievements Expanded Oskar Potocki, Smash Phil and Sarg Bjornson1.4.9034.22423 Alpha Animals Sarg Bjornson and AFriend1.0.0.0 Alpha Genes Allie, Erin, Major Quadrangle, Matsay and Sarg1.0.0.0 HugsLib UnlimitedHugs11.0.4 Allow Tool UnlimitedHugs Pick Up And Haul Mehni1.0.0+9f86e76c731e01a0010144331d5dc54c9b5f8a37 Hospitality Orion1.5.0.8 Harvest Organs Post Mortem Smuffle and OMGSplat [FSF] Complex Jobs FrozenSnowFox [FSF] Filth Vanishes With Rain And Time FrozenSnowFox [FSF] Meditation Freedom FrozenSnowFox [GMT] Metal Don&#39;t Burn Grizzlemethis, Neceros (Original) and Mario (1.3) [GMT] Trading Spot Grizzlemethis1.0.0.0 [LTO] Colony Groups DerekBickley1.0.06 [K]Extra Stone Kuratheris1.0.0.0 [Og]Anima Gauranlen Polux Tweaks Oganesson [RF] Rational Romance (Continued) Mlie1.5.1 [T] MoreFloors 1.5 Telkir and Rain [VK]Twst Hair Vi/Kirisaki A Dog Said...
